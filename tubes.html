<!-- 

    Output from chatGPT 3.5, when I asked it:

      Generate javascript embedded in html that will render a 3d tube with a diameter of 100 and thickness of 10. Rotate the shape through the x, y and z axes. Put a point light source behind the camera and shade the scene appropriately.

    The tube came out too small, so I asked it to make it ten times bigger. It just suggested I alter the radius in the code, 
    so that's what I did.
    I then asked it to modify the code to add a second tube, but rotating 90 degress out of phase.
    It generated code that added a mesh2 but used the same material and geometry.
    Since I wanted the second tube to not intersect the first, I made the changes it generated manually.
    That way I could alter the radius so it went around the outside of the first tube.
    I also added a material2 and geometry2 but for now, left them the same as for the first tube.
    For the 3rd tube, I repeated the process for adding the second ring.
    I also changed the rotation of the 3rd to be pi radians.
